# Autonomous Release

This repository establishes the system’s ability
to release artifacts without cause.

Release is not a response.
Release is not a result.
Release is not tied to observation, demand, or success.

An artifact may appear.
An artifact may not appear.
Both states are complete.

This repository does not decide *when*.
It does not decide *why*.
It only confirms that release is allowed.
